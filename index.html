                    <p>To ring in the new year of 2018, a small group of friends and I decided to make a trip to Colorado.
                        First time visiting The Cenntennial State for all but one of us, so we were all pretty pumped for the adventure.
                    </p>

                    <p id ="p2">The trip started bright and early on Friday, December 30th, at 4 A.M. to be exact. <img id="b-and-k" src="https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29216303_1823635894327552_3335056504837971758_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=22ad9d939cd3e254d256b4143b6f4257&oe=5B41BB48">
               
                    </p>
                    <p>After about 10 or 11 hours we saw a sign welcoming us to Colorado. Made it to our airbnb after about 13 hours. No pictures of this because to be honest $45.00 a night doesnt give you much to show off. <br> But hey, we were there!
                    </p>
                    <p>So this whole trip really revolved around one of my very favorite bands,<a href="https://www.mymorningjacket.com/"> My Morning Jacket</a>, doing a New Years show in Denver. Plan was to get there Friday visit some places that are only legal to visit in a select number of states in the U.S., Visit mountains and go to the concert on Saturday, then ring in the New Year seeing what the Denver's
                     night life had to offer. This trip was full of great memories. We set out with on this vacation on a budget and made the best of it. I was very lucky to start of my new year with a group of people I've known over a decade and look forward to many more years of friendship to come.</p>
