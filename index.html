                    <p>To ring in the new year of 2018, a small group of friends and I decided to make a trip to Colorado.
                        First time visiting The Cenntennial State for all but one of us, so we were all pretty pumped for the adventure.
                    </p>

                    <p>After about 10 or 11 hours of driving on what seemed like the never ending I-70 across Kansas we saw a sign welcoming us to Colorado! Special thank you to my pals 
                    on the <em>My Favorite Murder</em> podcast for entertainment along the way. Have some extra time on your hands?<a href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/"> Check 'em out!</a>
                    So we had two and a half days to see what Colorado had to offer. Not much but hey that's vacationing on an extreme budget and poor planning.
